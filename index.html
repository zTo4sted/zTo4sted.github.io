            hi. im alouneri, aka zto4sted.<br><br>
            i am a weird antisocial short asian american ~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~~.
            i am studying to become a computer engineer. i have been on the internet way earlier than i should have. 
            it is a miracle i am still here today. 
            there are still people in the world who enjoy my presence, and i appreciate them for doing so.<br><br>
            im not good at a lot of things, especially when it comes to interacting with people physically or anything relating to education. 
            i am especially not good at writing and speaking my primary language, which is english. 
            i hope that this is at least partially readable. 
            i hope i can get a job when i graduate, since it’ll be nice to splurge with my own money once in a while.<br><br>
            i used to love cars and enjoy playing racing games, but now i have leaned toward casual gaming and gacha games such as genshin and honkai star rail. 
            though i play other games, such as rocket league and osu!, along with other gacha games, genshin and honkai are the two games i enjoy playing the most casually. 
            outside of games, i love yuri (would like some recommendations please, manga or anime are fine), 
            my favorite color is pastel pink, followed up by pastel blue, 
            and i wish to one day embrace the cute kawaii cozy type aesthetic that is commonly seen in girls who are shorter than average height.<br><br>
            for now, this website will continue to have this unicolor bland design until the end of time; 
            i currently do not have the time or the motivation to learn more html/css.<br><br>
            i am not sure how i want to implement this, but i will leave a list of links for you to go through if you want to see more of my stuff.<br>

            currently the only way to contact me is through discord, my username being <b>zTo4sted</b>, as my other socials are either private or inactive. 
            i doubt anyone looking on this website is a stranger and not someone who saw this on discord, anyway. 
            if you are a stranger (or not, i dont mind), then thank you for scrolling through my website, i really appreciate it <3
